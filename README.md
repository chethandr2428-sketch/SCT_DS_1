# SCT_DS_1
This repository contains Python code and visualizations to analyze and display population data. It demonstrates how to create histograms for continuous variables (like Age) and bar charts for categorical variables (like Gender). The project also includes a sample dataset to help users practice data visualization with pandas and matplotlib.

# Population Data Visualizations


This project demonstrates how to visualize population data using Python's **pandas** and **matplotlib** libraries. It includes:

- **Histogram for Age Distribution:** Shows the frequency of different age groups in the population.
- **Bar Chart for Gender Distribution:** Shows the count of males and females.

## Dataset
The dataset `population_data_large.csv` includes the following columns:
- **Name** – Name of the individual
- **Age** – Age of the individual
- **Gender** – Gender (Male/Female)

## Install required libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib

## Run the Python script:
python plot_population.py

## Generated graphs will be saved as:
  *age_distribution.png
  *gender_distribution.png
